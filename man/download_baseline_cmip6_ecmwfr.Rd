\title{Download historical CMIP6 Data via the ecwfr package}
\usage{
download_baseline_cmip6_ecmwfr(
  area,
  model = "match_downloaded",
  service = "cds",
  frequency = "monthly",
  variable = c("Tmin", "Tmax"),
  year_start = 1985,
  year_end = 2014,
  month = 1:12,
  sec_wait = 3600,
  n_try = 10,
  update_everything = FALSE,
  path_download = "cmip6_downloaded",
  user = "ecmwfr",
  key = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{numeric vector of length 4. Sets the spatial boundaries of the
downloaded data. Coordinates are supplied in the following format: 
c(maximum latitude, minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude),
which corresponds to the northern extent, western extent, southern extent
and eastern extent of the area of interest.}

\item{model}{character, by default "match_downloaded". Looks up the already downloaded GCMs for
the climate change scenarios of the "download_cmip6_ecmwfr()" function. You can
also specify the models by name as a vector.}

\item{service}{character, by default 'cds'. Decides which database is used.
For more details see in the documentation of
\code{\link[ecmwfr:wf_set_key]{ecmwfr::wf_set_key()}}.}

\item{frequency}{character, can be either 'daily' or 'monthly'. Sets
if the downloaded CMIP6 data is in daily or monthly format.}

\item{variable}{vector of characters, decides which variables get downloaded. 
Currently, the options "Tmin" (Daily minimum temperature in degree centigrade), 
"Tmax" (Daily maximum temperature in degree centigrade) 
and "Prec" (Daily sum of precipitation in mm) are the only valid options.}

\item{year_start}{numeric, earliest year for downloaded CMIP6 data. By default set
to 1985.}

\item{year_end}{numeric, latest year for downloaded CMIP6 data. By default set
to 2014.}

\item{month}{numeric vector, sets for which months data should be downloaded.
By default set to 1:12.}

\item{sec_wait}{numeric, sets the maximum waiting time per requested file.
By default is 3600, so 1 hour.}

\item{n_try}{numeric, number of repeated calls for the API. For more
information see 'Details'.}

\item{update_everything}{logical, by default set to FALSE. When set to FALSE,
scenarios with matching names that have already been downloaded are skipped.
If set to TRUE, then files are downloaded regardless if a file with the same
name is already present.}

\item{path_download}{character, sets the path for the download of the CMIP6
file. If not already present, then a new folder will be created. 
The path is relative to the working directory.}

\item{user}{a character, user name provided by ECMWF data service. The default 
"ecmwfr" should be fine. Otherwise provide the email address which was
used to sign-up at ECMWF / Copernicus Climate Data Store}

\item{key}{a character. Can be found just beneath the user id on the profile
when registering for the Copernicus website next to "Personal Access Token". 
Should be provided as a character (so in quotation marks).}
}
\value{
NULL, the downloaded files are saved in the stated directory
}
\description{
Accesses the CMIP6 data of the Copernicus API via the
\code{\link[ecmwfr:wf_request_batch]{ecmwfr}} package. Saves the downloaded
files as .zip objects in the specified path in a subfolder with the
coordinates of the downloaded area as subfolder name. You can either specify
the GCMs by name or you can take all GCMs for which you downloaded climate 
change scenarios (model = "match_downloaded").
