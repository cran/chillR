#' Download historical CMIP6 Data via the ecwfr package
#' 
#' Accesses the CMIP6 data of the Copernicus API via the
#' \code{\link[ecmwfr:wf_request_batch]{ecmwfr}} package. Saves the downloaded
#' files as .zip objects in the specified path in a subfolder with the
#' coordinates of the downloaded area as subfolder name. You can either specify
#' the GCMs by name or you can take all GCMs for which you downloaded climate 
#' change scenarios (model = "match_downloaded").
#' 
#' @param area numeric vector of length 4. Sets the spatial boundaries of the
#' downloaded data. Coordinates are supplied in the following format: 
#' c(maximum latitude, minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude),
#' which corresponds to the northern extent, western extent, southern extent
#' and eastern extent of the area of interest.
#' 
#' @param model character, by default "match_downloaded". Looks up the already downloaded GCMs for
#' the climate change scenarios of the "download_cmip6_ecmwfr()" function. You can
#' also specify the models by name as a vector.
#' 
#' @param service character, by default 'cds'. Decides which database is used.
#' For more details see in the documentation of
#' \code{\link[ecmwfr:wf_set_key]{ecmwfr::wf_set_key()}}.
#' 
#' @param frequency character, can be either 'daily' or 'monthly'. Sets
#' if the downloaded CMIP6 data is in daily or monthly format.
#' 
#' @param variable vector of characters, decides which variables get downloaded. 
#' Currently, the options "Tmin" (Daily minimum temperature in degree centigrade), 
#' "Tmax" (Daily maximum temperature in degree centigrade) 
#' and "Prec" (Daily sum of precipitation in mm) are the only valid options.
#' 
#' @param year_start numeric, earliest year for downloaded CMIP6 data. By default set
#' to 1985.
#' 
#' @param year_end numeric, latest year for downloaded CMIP6 data. By default set
#' to 2014.
#' 
#' @param month numeric vector, sets for which months data should be downloaded.
#' By default set to 1:12.
#' 
#' @param sec_wait numeric, sets the maximum waiting time per requested file.
#' By default is 3600, so 1 hour.
#' 
#' @param n_try numeric, number of repeated calls for the API. For more
#' information see 'Details'.
#' 
#' @param update_everything logical, by default set to FALSE. When set to FALSE,
#' scenarios with matching names that have already been downloaded are skipped.
#' If set to TRUE, then files are downloaded regardless if a file with the same
#' name is already present.
#' 
#' @param path_download character, sets the path for the download of the CMIP6
#' file. If not already present, then a new folder will be created. 
#' The path is relative to the working directory.
#' @param user a character, user name provided by ECMWF data service. The default 
#' "ecmwfr" should be fine. Otherwise provide the email address which was
#' used to sign-up at ECMWF / Copernicus Climate Data Store 
#' 
#' @param key a character. Can be found just beneath the user id on the profile
#' when registering for the Copernicus website next to "Personal Access Token". 
#' Should be provided as a character (so in quotation marks).
#' 
#' @return NULL, the downloaded files are saved in the stated directory
